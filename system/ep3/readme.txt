Fuzziqer Software MINA

Notes:

- The included decks have only what they say - i.e. creature.mnd comtains only creature cards.
- You must have four players to begin a game.
- Unlike PSO3, the game is a free-for-all; there are no teams.
- To advance to the next phase, click on the phase indicator.
- When attacking, after selecting all the cards to be used in the attack, press an arrow key to tell which direction to attack in. Note that the range info for the last card you chose will be used.
- At any time, you can press ESCAPE to cancel your current action (i.e. setting up an attack, moving a card, equipping a card) if it has not already completed.

Bugs / Missing Stuff:

- Rolling to determine who goes first has no effect on the game (the players play in standard order regardless of what they roll).
- You can't edit the battle rules.
- No special effects on any cards are implemented.
- There may be something wrong with the Defense phase.
- Various things I overlooked due to not testing this program.
